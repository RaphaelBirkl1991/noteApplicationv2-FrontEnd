## This is the frontend repo for the Note Application. I created this App in an course from getarrays to learn about reactive programming with RxJS. 


## 1. App overview

## This is the main view of the App. One can create an new Note, delete or update an existing one and filter them by priority. 
## The bootstrap UI is was originally from Bootdey (https://bootdey.com/snippets/view/notes-dashboard).

## 2. Adding a new note

## You have to name a title, give an description and choose a priority.

## 3. Edit an existing Note

## You mistyped or simply want to change the Note?

## 4. Filter Notes 

## Don´t get overwhelmed and filter by priority!

## 5. Immediate reaction

## Performing the CRUD Operations in the Database can take a while. Thanks to the reactive approach, you will gett immediate feedback. ## No "freezing" in the App thanks to the Loading-State.

## 6. Continous feedback 

## Did something went wrong? Or is everythng fine? You´ll get continous feedback (using ngx-toastr).
